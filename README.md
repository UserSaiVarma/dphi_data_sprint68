### About:
   - Data Sprint 68 is a part of World Data League, an international non-profit competition that gathers the best minds in the Data Science field to develop long-lasting solutions for social impact challenges. In this, you will have an opportunity to work on a dataset that aims to solve one of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and create a larget social impact.
   - Identification and classification of crop pests are one of the major challenges in the field of agriculture. Plants are damaged by insects, which mainly affect the productivity of crops. Classification of pests is a difficult task due to the complex structure and having a high degree of similarity of the appearance between distinct species. It is necessary to recognize and classify insects in the crops at an early stage, especially to prevent the spread of insects, which cause crop diseases by selecting effective pesticides and biological control methods. Traditional manual identification of insects is typically labour-intensive, time-consuming and inefficient.
    
### Data Overview:
   - The data consists of images captured from the Mango farms affected by 15-categories of pests which are identifiable through structural and visual deformity exhibited in the Mango leaves. The collection of the data involved the use of a low-cost sensing equipment that are commonly used by the farmers for collecting images from the farm. 
   - Below are the different types of pest categories:
1. mictis_longicornis
2.  apoderus_javanicus
3.   valanga_nigricornis
4.   dappula_tertia
5.   normal
6.   neomelicharia_sparsa
7.   dialeuropora_decempuncta
8.   icerya_seychellarum
9.   procontarinia_matteiana
10.   procontarinia_rubus
11.   orthaga_euadrusalis
12.   cisaberoptus_kenyae
13.   erosomyia_sp
14.   aulacaspis_tubercularis
